# About Us

The Electronics and Robotics Club (ERC) of BITS Goa is a diverse group of students with interests ranging from electronics to machine learning to mechanical design. Over the years, we have evolved into a platform to learn and experiment with various aspects of science and engineering and to apply them in robotics. We are open to anyone with a general interest in engineering and who wants to explore robotics, so feel free to get in touch with us.

This is a compilation of notes based on research papers and other related resources that we have gone through, making it easier for anyone who wants to refer to these resources, providing them with an introductory, yet detailed summary on what is covered in these papers.

You can find out more about us on our [website](https://erc-bpgc.github.io/) and [blog](https://erc-bpgc.github.io/blog/).
